A game that my friends and I did at HackUPC (Autum) 

It's a 2D/3D platform game where you are a misterious being that must go forward throught the obstacles.

The mechanics are simple. You have to Kill YourSelf to get to the state of ghost and this way being able to make actions that you couldn't when you were alive.
Magically, you will be resurected in a certain amount of time.

There are only 2 levels, as we only had less than 36h.

All the proccess of getting the idea, processing, creating, coding it were done in less than 36h.
